# Here's a simple example endpoint.
# The application's `get()` method allows us to define the function
# following the annotation as an API endpoint function. The first
# parameter of this annotation function is the path of the endpoint.
# Note that the actual function name can be anything.

# We can also define path parameters as part of this annotation function.
# FastAPI will recognize path parts surrounded by curly brackets {} as
# path parameters.
# You can then define function parameters whose name match your path
# parameters. FastAPI will automatically set those values to the path
# parameters' values.
# Note that FastAPI will perform type validation for you if you specify
# a type hint on the parameter.

# 1. We can do various HTTP methods using the FastAPI route annotations.
# 2. Dependency injection. More on that shortly.
# 3. We can validate response format using function return type hints.

    # Note the FastAPI Depends() method. This allows us to specify additional
    # methods to run when we receive a request.
    # Also, note that there are no other parameters than these Depends. You
    # can specify request body parameters and query string parameters as
    # method parameters here, or you can do it via your dependency methods.
    # **Do note that I don't recommend what I'm doing here.** Using
    # dependencies to specify endpoint parameters makes it harder to trace
    # logic, especially since you can have multiple layers of dependencies.
    # I just wanted to make a point of it.
    # Also, notice how `check_auth` also depends on `get_user_info`. FastAPI
    # automatically builds a dependency graph and prevents the same dependency
    # from being called multiple times. `get_user_info` will only be called once.
    # Note that you can also use classes as dependencies. The `Depends()`
    # function accepts any Callable, so a class's constructor will be called
    # when used as a dependency. You can do some interesting behavior with
    # this, so be sure to consider it when you're building things.
